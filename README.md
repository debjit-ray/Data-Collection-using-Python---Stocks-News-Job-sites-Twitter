In the current project, we will be collecting data from various sources to build a data repository, which can be then fed to the ML model. Current project only addresses the data collection.


Any organization’s performance can be outlined by reviewing the following aspects:
- Customers Feedback 
- Performance of Share 
- Employee Feedback
- News bytes/ Overall Sentiment
- Management Outlook
- Sector/ Market’s performance
- Large Funds & Broker house recommendations 
This project intends to collect data from various sources. 

The collected data can be fed to a model which will take all the above aspects and build a solution to help rate organization(s)/ industry sector. This rating can then help predicting whether investing in this organization for a period (short/ long term) makes sense.
